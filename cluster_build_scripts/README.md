# BUILDING SHCI on the H2P
Run the build_shcii.sh script on the cluster to clone the [shci repo](https://github.com/QMC-Cornell/shci), and compile for mpi using the intel compilers.
By default the scipt checkouts the stable version of the repo, you can delete the `git checkout stable` line if you would like to work with the developer version instead
