 ## Singularity
 Containers allow clean compilation environments and portability between hardward.
 Singularity is a container that works well with HPC environments.
 This is because singularity containers can be build locally with root access, but do not require root access to run.

Singularity can be installed locally following [these instructions](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.2/user-guide/installation.html). On H2P, singularity is already a compile module.
